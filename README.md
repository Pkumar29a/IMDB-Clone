Mini IMDB Clone
A mini IMDB clone application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This app allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and add them to favorites.

Features
Search Movies: Users can search for movies using the search bar. As they type, the search results update dynamically, similar to Google's suggestions.

View Movie Details: Clicking on any search result redirects users to a new page displaying detailed information about that particular movie, including its name, poster, plot, year, director, actors, and IMDB rating.

Add to Favorites: Each search result has an "Add to Favorites" button. Clicking on it adds the movie to the user's favorites list.

Favorites Page: Users can view their favorite movies on a dedicated page. The favorites list is persistent, meaning it remains intact even after closing or refreshing the browser.

Remove from Favorites: Each movie in the favorites list has a "Remove from Favorites" button. Clicking on it removes the movie from the favorites list.
